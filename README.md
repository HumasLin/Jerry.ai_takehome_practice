Hi!

This is Haomin Lin, and this repository includes my response to two questions in the take home practice regarding my application for Data Analyst position at Jerry.ai.

- My answer to the analytical question is presented in Analytical/Jerry.ai_Data_Analyst_Question.pdf.

- Solution to the coding question is a Python program Coding/coding_jerry.py, which you can simply run directly according to Coding/README.

Thank you so much!

All the best,

Haomin
